We are doing all our planning here @frontend-planning/  and we have currently undergone phases 1 and 2. But I noticed we left something out of the planning process. In Streamlit, you will see we have a model management page: @pages/7_ðŸ¤–_Models.py which allows users to manage their models. We need to replicate this functionality in the new frontend.

Most of the features are already exposed via APIs, but there is a model avaialbility check done in the streamlit page based on ENV Variables. This would be better suited if we could move it to the API layer and expose it via an endpoint. 

  1. Provider Availability API:
    - Should I create a new endpoint like GET /api/models/providers that returns
  available/unavailable providers based on environment variables?
    - What information should this endpoint return? Just provider names and availability
  status, or should it include what environment variables are needed?
  2. Frontend Design:
    - Should the React model management page follow the same layout as the Streamlit version
   (grouped by model type with cards)?
    - Do you want to maintain the same user flow, or would you like any improvements?
  3. Esperanto Integration:
    - I notice the Streamlit page uses AIFactory.get_available_providers() - should the API
  endpoint use the same method to determine which providers support which model types?
  4. Model Validation:
    - Should we validate that users can only add models from providers that are actually
  configured (have API keys)?
  5. UI/UX Considerations:
    - Should we add any new features like:
        - Testing a model configuration before saving?
      - Showing which models are currently in use?
      - Model usage statistics?
